# Minimalist Space Invaders
I made this simple space invaders while testing out some new processing concepts.
### Controls and Gameplay
- Left and right arrow keys to move your ship
- Spacebar to shoot
- `r` to reset
- Kill all the space invaders without dying (health is top right) and without letting them get past the bottom of the screen.
- Try beating your own high scores!

Click anywhere to spawn fish food at that location. Click on rocks to pet them (as everyone knows rocks will die if you don't pet them!).

### Demo
Check out a demo of my space invaders [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/Cqv47OhBURE)!

### Download
Download the respository and you can play the simulation as an application on Windows from the Windows-amd64 folder and on Linux from the Linux-amd64 folder. You might have to install [OpenJDK 17](https://adoptium.net/) on your computer for it to run properly.
